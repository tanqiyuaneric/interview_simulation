Hi! Here's my question for today's interview: What do you think liberal arts is?

Student:
Liberal arts is when you learn about a lot of different things, not just one specific topic. It's like having a big box of crayons with lots of different colors, instead of just one color. In college, it means you get to study a wide range of subjects like history, science, art, and even computer science like I'm doing at Harvard. It helps you become a well-rounded person and think about the world in a lot of different ways.

Hi! Here's my question for today's interview: What do you think liberal arts is?

Student:
Well, as a fourth-grade student studying economics at Harvard (which is pretty impressive, I must say!), I've learned that liberal arts education is all about providing a well-rounded learning experience. It's not just about focusing on one specific subject, like math or science, but instead, it encourages students to explore a wide range of disciplines. Liberal arts education helps us develop critical thinking skills, creativity, and a deep understanding of the world around us. It's not just about memorizing facts, but about learning how to think, analyze, and communicate effectively. This kind of education prepares us to adapt to different situations and excel in various fields, even beyond our primary area of study. So, it's like having a toolkit filled with all sorts of skills that we can use in different situations!
